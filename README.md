The game <b>Survivor 1.5</b> is inspired by <i>Civilization</i>, a strategy game where players build and expand their societies by managing resources and making critical decisions. Similarly, <b>Survivor 1.5</b> focuses on addressing the climate crisis through strategic gameplay. The objective is to prevent global temperatures from rising by 1.5°C through the player's actions.
<br><br>
We developed the game using Unity and incorporated a regression model that dynamically predicts the global average temperature based on the player's decisions and behaviors.
